## [2.0.0.1] - 2018-05-30
### Fix
 -comeet-data.php
    Added missing !
    It being missing wouldn't let content be displayed even when it existed.

## [2.0.1.0] - 2018-06-25
### Fix
 -comeet-data.php
    Stopped calling function from Comeet statically as it was throwing a Deprected warning - created an identical static function in comeet-data and calling that statically
 -comeet.php Better handling of the debug function, in some cases the function was being called with variables that were not set - checking for variable isset now first (not in all cases)
 -comeet-position-page-common.php Better handling of the debug function, in some cases the function was being called with variables that were not set - checking for variable isset now first (not in all cases)


## [2.0.1.1] - 2018-07-15
### Fix
 -comeet.php
    Fixing issue with job posting Schema.

## [2.0.1.2] - 2018-07-16
### Fix
 -comeet.php
    Fixing issue with job posting Schema - The descrioption could have slashes that would cause the JSON to not be valid.
    Fix - Addslashes to the descriotion value - so special characters are escaped.

## [2.0.2] - 2018-10-08
### Changed
 - comeet.php
    Added a check for WP_error - when the API test call is made. Better handling of errors, if an error is detected, the error message will be displayed in the admin dashboard.
 -comeet-data.php
    Added a timeout to the cURL call that is made to the API - 5 seconds
    Changed caching mechanism, the cache now does NOT expire automatically, but lasts for ever.
    In addition to the Data Cache, we also store the time the last API call was made. The data will be pulled from cache for 30 minutes,
    after 30 minutes a new API call is made and the cache is updated along with the call time.
    If the API call fails for what ever reason, the data will continue to be pulled from Cache and the time will be reset, so another API call will not be attempted for 30 minutes.
    This is to allow for API failure or Server issues (cURL not working for some reason) while still showing content on the front end.

## [2.0.3] - 2018-10-09
### Changed
 -comeet.php
    When saving settings the cache will be cleared.
    Please note that the cache will ONLY be cleared if the API call works correctly. If the cache exists and the API call fails cache will NOT be replaced.
 -comeet-data.php
    Modified the function that fetches the data. When settings are saved a new options parameter is passed into the funciton: "clear_comeet_cache", if this parameter isset in the
    options array, the API call will be made and if succesfull the Cache will be updated. If the API call fails, cache will not be updated!

## [2.0.4] - 2018-12-12
### Changed
 -comeet.php
    The 404 function that handles redirecting in cases that the page is a Comeet page, will not check if there are
    GET parameters in the URL, and if so, pass them on.
    This is to handle cases of UTM and other such parameters.

## [2.0.5] - 2018-12-12
### Changed
 -comeet.php
    Added trim to UID and Token validation function - this is to handle cases where the UID or Token that is copied and pasted has extra spaces in the start or end of the string, which can cause issues and errors.
    Thank you page will now have the comeet.js included in the head.

    Fix issue with Comeet logo not showing. Expected Plugin folder was comeet-wp-plugin but it was sometimes different when users downloaded from Github.
    After this fix the logo will appear no matter what the plugin folder is named.

## [2.0.5.7] - 2019-06-03
### Fix

    Renamed all refrences to clean( to comeet_string_clean( to avoid naming conflicts with other functions called clean (That could appear in other plugins, themes or what not.)

## [2.0.6] - 2019-05-04

## [2.0.6.1] - 2019-08-04
### Fix
 -comeet.php
    Adding fix for canonical meta tags.
    Making sure the meta tag is correct + includes the coref url parameter when preset - fix for LinkedIn sharing.
    Improving how the filter_url function works - Just displaying the current URL + making sure that the coref parameter continues to pass.
    This all works with or without Yoast SEO plugin

## [2.0.6.5] - 2019-27-05
### Changed
 -comeet.php
    Moved Meta tag editing so that it ONLY happens if the page is a Comeet page, containing the Comeet ShortCode.
    Improved OG:image handling
 -comeet-data.php
    Improved position UID comparison, we had cases where the UID's being compared where upper case and lower case, so strtolower added to ensure that they are the same case.

## [2.0.6.6] - 2019-15-10
### Changed
 -comeet.php
    Added debug output - this is used when debugging issues with the plugin using the debug_comeet_plugin get parameter
### Fix
 -comeet-data.php
    Cases where there are no open positions would result in an error from the API (not realy, the plugin treated it as such)
    Fixed this case by not checking for Empty (which would throw the false error) but instead checking for array.

## [2.0.6.7] - 2019-21-10
### Changed
 -comeet.php
    It Seems that LinkedIn fetches the title from the wrong location. As long as we have the oembed meta tags in the page,
    LinkedIn will take the title from the oembed page/code. As a fix, on the individual position pages, we remove the oembed meta tags. (This removal is limited to the position pages)


## [2.0.6.8] - 2019-16-12

### Changed
 -comeet.php
    No longer relying on "has_shortcode" to check if the page is a Comeet page.
    With the use of plugins such as ACF's this is no longer reliable. We now compare the post ID to the post that was set in the Comeet Settings page.

###Update

    WPML plugin has a very aggressive URL rewriting, as a result Position URL's would be overwriten
